# Gator
Gator started as a small project to built a set of multipurpose, breadboard friendly TTL gates. It has since morphed into the endeavour to create a complete CPU built out of only discrete NPN transistors, resistors and capacitors.

## Errata
- The current instruction set is missing any way to read a memory address from a register. This makes pointers, array iterations and linked list impossible or at least very hard.
